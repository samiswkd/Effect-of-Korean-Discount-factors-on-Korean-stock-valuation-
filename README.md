# Effect of Korean Discount factors on Korean stock valuation 

This project was based on a Research Paper I conducted in my ECON 191(Topics in Economic Research) class during my exchange abroad program in UCB.

## I. Introduction
 Korean stock market has been considered as a typical low-growing market for recent few decades. Korea Composite Stock Price Index(KOSPI) has grown 21.12% for last 5 years, far below than 79.19% of S&P500 for the same period. 

 This is mainly due to the "Korean Discount" factors(KD factors). These are the main factors existing in Korea that are related to the relatively low stock prices compared to it's theoretical valuation. KD factors can be largely divided into 2 groups, macroeconomic(or geopolitical) factors regarding potential North Korea's rusk and microeconomic risks such as conglomerate's governance problems.

I tried to find whether there is a statistically significant relationship between KD factors and real valuation of Korean stocks.
